# A statically generated blog example using Next.js and Markdown...

#...ON FLEEK

This is the original nextjs/vercel demo version seen here:

[https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/](https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)

This version has been stripped down and reconfigured to work on IPFS with Fleek.

Just type in the following:

git clone https://github.com/lpgcode/nextjs_mxd_blog_onfleek.git 

Change your origin to your own repo, push it, hit npm run dev - and then start styling!

When you're ready point https://fleek.co/ to your repo get back to your regularly scheduled JAM stack workflow.

I'll be configuring a basic styled components starter built off this too, check back soon!
