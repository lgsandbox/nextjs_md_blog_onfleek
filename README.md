# ...ON FLEEK

This is a conversion of the OG nextjs/vercel demo version seen here:

[https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/](https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)

This version has been stripped down and reconfigured to work on IPFS with Fleek. This version is free of any styling.

To get started with the starter:

git clone https://github.com/lpgcode/nextjs_mxd_blog_onfleek.git

npm install && npm run dev - and then start styling

When ready slap down all your git commands (make sure your origin is yours!) and do what must be done to "git" it to your GitHub. Yes I make funny, very good.

Then just point https://fleek.co/ to your repo and BAM just like that you can get back to your regularly scheduled JAM stack workflow, now on IPFS. Thanks Fleek!
